        I love doing handicrafts. During my free time I decorate my house with my crafts and
        I use waste materials to create new items . I like reading novels.I mostly read horror
        thrill genres. I like to travel to new places and explore them.</p>
    <h4>Biryani</h4>
    <p>I like biryani because it has lot of spices in it and it is a famous indian food.Biryani includes
        spices such as garlic,ginger and cummin seeds that are characterized for digestive benefits.
